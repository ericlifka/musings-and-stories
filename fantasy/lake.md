The sun was just dipping behind the tops of the trees as I made my way down the shore line.
It was mid fall and the air was starting to get chili.
Soon it would be too cold to make the journey up here.
 
I took off my bag and set it on a now familiar rock by the water's edge.
I rummaged inside, pulling out my light stone.
It was a big clunky affair, rough quartz with no clarity to it.
No good for any real lights, but suitable for my needs as a beacon.

With a mental prod the enchantment, already laid into the stone on a similar trip earlier this summer, came to life and the stone lit up with a strong glow.
Another prod and the stone's reservoir  was tied into the local flow.
It could now sustain itself through the night. 
A final prod and the hover enchantment was activated and the stone floated up above my head, about six feet in the air.
At that height I'd be able to see it across the water, to guide me back.

I stripped off my clothing, setting it in loose a pile on the rock.
I shivered slightly as the cool air whispered over my skin.
Reaching back into my bag I pulled out my waist pouch and tied it around my hips.

I stepped into the water, a small gasp escaping my lips.
It was bitterly cold.
