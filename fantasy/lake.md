The sun was just dipping behind the tops of the trees as I made my way down the shore line.
It was mid fall and the air was starting to get a bite to it.
This was most likely my last collection trip for the year.
Soon it would be too cold to make the journey.
 
I took off my bag and set it on a now very familiar rock by the water's edge.
I rummaged inside, pulling out my light stone.
It was a big clunky affair, rough quartz with no clarity to it.
No good for any real lights, but suitable for my needs as a beacon.

With a mental prod the enchantment, already laid into the stone on a similar trip earlier this summer, came to life and the stone lit up with a strong glow.
Another prod and the hover enchantment was activated and the stone floated up above my head, about six feet in the air.
A final prod and the stone's reservoir was tied into the local flow.
It could now sustain itself through the night. 
At that height I'd be able to see it across the water, to guide me back.

I stripped off my clothing, setting it in loose a pile on the rock.
I shivered slightly as the cool air whispered over my skin.
Reaching back into my bag I pulled out my waist pouch and tied it around my hips.

I stepped into the water, a small gasp escaping my lips.
It was bitterly cold.

I strode out into the lake with purpose.
No sense standing around freezing to death.
When the water reached my waste I gave up on walking plunged forward with a strong breast stroke.

With my hair pulled back it shouldn't get too wet.
Which was good.
Wet hair made the whole affair much more miserable.

The lake was long and twisting, but not terribly wide.
It only took about ten minutes of steady swimming to reach the other side.
Nonetheless my teeth were chattering by the time I stepped out of the water.
