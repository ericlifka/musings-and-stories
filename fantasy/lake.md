The sun was just dipping behind the tops of the trees as I made my way down the shore line.
It was mid fall and the air was starting to get a bite to it.
This was most likely my last collection trip for the year.
Soon it would be too cold to make the journey.
 
I took off my bag and set it on a now very familiar rock by the water's edge.
I rummaged inside, pulling out my light stone.
It was a big clunky affair, rough quartz with no clarity to it.
No good for any real lights, but suitable for my needs as a beacon.

With a mental prod the enchantment, already laid into the stone on a similar trip earlier this summer, came to life and the stone lit up with a strong glow.
Another prod and the hover enchantment was activated and the stone floated up above my head, about six feet in the air.
A final prod and the stone's reservoir was tied into the local flow.
It could now sustain itself for several days. 
At that height I'd be able to see it across the water, to guide me back.

I stripped off my clothing, setting it in loose a pile on the rock.
I shivered slightly as the cool air whispered over my skin.
Reaching back into my bag I pulled out my waist pouch and tied it around my hips.

I stepped into the water, a small gasp escaping my lips.
It was bitterly cold.

I strode out into the lake with purpose.
No sense standing around freezing to death.
When the water reached my waste I gave up on walking plunged forward with a strong breast stroke.

With my hair pulled back it shouldn't get too wet.
Which was good.
Wet hair made the whole affair much more miserable.

The lake was long and twisting, but not terribly wide.
It only took about ten minutes of steady swimming to reach the other side.
Nonetheless my teeth were chattering by the time I stepped out of the water.

I scanned the treeline, looking for the telltale signs of my small camp in the fading light.
I spotted it about twenty paces off.
It was just far enough under the trees to not be exposed, but still on the sandy shore.

I walked over, shaking and rubbing as much of the water from my skin as I could.
The camp consisted of very little, just a pre-made campfire I left for myself and an old warn out blanket tucked under a tree root.
I pulled out the blanket and wrapped it around myself.
It was somewhat damp, and more than a little musty, but I was glad for the warmth it provided.

The small campfire I had left prepared was strewn about, probably animal curiosity.
I gathered up the small sticks and remade the loose pile.
A small mental suggestion was all it took to bring a small flame to the pile.
Nature would take care of the rest.
I spent the last of the daylight gathering larger branches and deadwood to fuel my small fire.
Once I had a small wood pile and a mid sized bonfire I stopped my labor and sat in the warmth.

I reached out to the warmth and cajoled it into enfolding me.
It seeped into my dingy blanket and drove the moisture away.
It enveloped my moist skin and turned the water to steam. 
Within minutes the heat was too much to bear and I let it go, returning to its normal path, billowing up from the fire into the night.
The cold night air was quick to fill the void, and I was sad for the loss.
