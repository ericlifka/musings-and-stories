The sun was just getting to the tops of the trees as I made my way down the shore line.
It was mid fall and the air was starting to get chili.
Soon it would be too cold for these evening hikes.
 
I took off my bag and set it on a now familiar rock by the water's edge.
I rummaged inside, pulling out my light stone.
It was a big clunky affair, rough quartz with no clarity to it.
No good for any real lights, but suitable for my needs.

With a mental prod the enchantment, already laid into the stone on a similar trip earlier this summer, came to life and the stone lit up with a strong glow.
Another prod and the stone was tied into a local current, so it would sustain itself. 
A final prod and the hover enchantment was activated and the stone floated up above my head, about six feet in the air.
At that height I'd be able to see it across the water, to guide me back.
